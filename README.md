# MSTL
This repo contains the notebook used to generate the figures in this [article]() on MSTL. 

## Summary

In the notebook we show how to decompose a time series with multiple seasonal components using an algorithm called Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess ([MSTL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13462.pdf)) in Python. We demo an implementation of MSTL that [we contributed](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/pull/8160) to Statsmodels and apply it to an electricity demand time series.

## Installation 

Create a virtual environment and pip install the requirements.
